#Learning PowerShell with HackerMouse

We've knocked up some simple powershell commands to show how to read/write files, search them for both simple strings and complex strings using REGEX!

We also show how to scrape a webpage and look for cheese strings (flags)

We also touch on WMI interfaces and use a FOR loop to cycle through the object.

This is just a quick demo. The mouse will write some more friendly content in the future!
